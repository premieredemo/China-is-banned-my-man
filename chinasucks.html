中国人是贪心的人，只是为了钱。他们使整个世界依赖于这样的事物 衣服和其他材料。每年赚几万亿美元，但拒绝允许，这并不明确
平民做同样的事情。
(The Chinese are greedy people that are only in it for the money. They make the whole world reliant on things like
clothes and other materials from them. It does not make any sense how they make trillions of dollars every year, but refuse to allow
civilians to do the same.)
